6.          Project Network/ Schedule (10 Marks) 
Notwithstanding your   team’s   inexperience, work through the steps   below and   develop   a reasonable schedule for the   Pacificano   Markets   project with your adjusted/   improved WBS from   above. 
a)          Further decompose the   lowest   level work   packages   in your adjusted/improved   WBS   into   activities to show at   least   15   activities.
b)       Arrange the   lowest   level   activities   into   a   logical   execution   order   and   identify the   type   of   dependencies   between them   in tabular format.
c)          Present your   interim work as   a   network   diagram   (without   any   durations)   illustrating   only the   different   logical dependencies – show an example of   the   3   common   types   of   dependencies.
d)          Identify who   might   be   best   placed   to   provide that   information or estimate for   each   activity.
e)          Describe   methods you would   use to obtain an   estimate   of time/effort   required for   each   activity.
f)             From the above considerations,   make an estimate   (i.e.   educated   guess)   for   the   durations   of   these activities and determine an overall project schedule needed to   deliver   the   project described.
g)          Identify which “network   path”   might   be expected to   have the   longest duration   explaining   your   reasoning/ answer and explaining what   it   represents.
7.          Estimate Project Budget (10 Marks) 
Similar to and   (ideally) together with the above   schedule   development,   use the   same   packages/   activities of your WBS developed above and   work   through   the   following   steps:
a)          Make a   reasoned estimate of the   personnel,   materials   and   equipment / facilities   required   for   each work   package.
b)          From the above considerations,   provide an   initial estimate   of   (i.e.   educated   guess)   of the overall project budget needed to execute the   project   described.
c)          Explain any assumptions   and   briefly   describe   how   you   came   to   the   estimate.
d)          Finally,   make a judgement on the confidence you   have on the   estimate   and   what   level   of   contingency   (as a   percentage) you would advise   the   project   use.
8.          Project Risks (10 Marks) 
a)          Should   it   be approved,   briefly describe   how for the   Pacificano   Markets   project team   might   go   about   identifying the   major   risks for this   project and the   process   used to   prioritise them and develop a   response   plan.
b)          Follow this   process yourself to   identify at   least ten   (10) of the   most   probable and/or   highest   impact   project   risks for the
project, ensuring that you   have at   least one   for   each   Level-3   work   package   (not   including   Project   Management).
c)          Show the overall   risk assessment   using a   Red-Amber-Green   (RAG)   rating   based on the   Risk   Matrix shown   here.
d)          Describe   how these   risks   could   potentially   impact/ affect the   project and explain   how you   might   manage these   risks w代 写PMGT5205_2024S2 Professional Project Practice PART B: A2 – Team ReportMatlab

e)          Identify the   Level-3 work   package with the   highest   risk and      briefly explain   how you would   report   it to   Pacificano   Mayor   and what support you would   ask   for.

9.          Quality Management (10 Marks) 
For each   Level-2 work   package   (not   including   Project   Management) and   based on your   understanding of the scenario:
a)          Identify two   (2)   non-functional   requirements   (a total of at   least   10   NFRs) which would   need   to   be clarified with   key stakeholders as   part of the   requirements   process.
b)          Pick any three   (3) work   packages and   briefly   describe:
•          The appropriate acceptance   criteria for   each   with the   Quality   Control   activity   that   would   ensure that the deliverables are of   a   suitable   standard.
•          What Quality Assurance   process   might   be   applied   earlier   in the   project   to   increase   the   confidence that the appropriate standards could   be   met?
10. Procurement (10 Marks) 
Pacificano   has a wide   bike   path that connects   key areas   of the town   and   goes   via the   proposed market’s site. As the site   is a   little out   of town   and   has   no   parking for   visitors,   the   Mayor   thinks   it would   be smart for the town to   purchase a fleet   of   cargo/courier   bikes   for the   community   to   use.
These are   not ordinary   bicycles and   need to   bee-bikes to support   Pacificano’s   sustainability   goals   as   well, as   being able to comfortably carry   the   produce   (estimated   at   up to   10kgs)   that   customers purchase from the   market stalls.
The   project team   is tasked with evaluating the different   e-bikes that   would   suit   Pacificano’s   needs,   and   the   Mayor   has   provided the following   information to   help you select the   most suitable   model:
•          The   e-bike   supplier   should   have   a   distributor   and   servicedepo   in   Australia
•          e-bike   models should   be   compliant with Transport   for   NSW   rules   and   regulations.
•          The e-bike   model should   be   safe/suitable for   commuting   up to   4   kms.
•          The e-bikes should   come   with the   necessary   accessories   (e.g.   helmet,   basket,   etc.)   and   be   included   in the final costing.
•          The costing details should   include   ongoing   maintenance   costs.
•          The costing details   should   include   provisions to   maintain   an   ongoing   inventory   of   30   e-bikes,   such as depreciation costs   and   replacement   costs.
With the above   input from the   Mayor:
a)          identify and   prioritise the   key   requirements and selection   criteria for the   cleaning   equipment.
b)          Undertake   market   research on suitable e-bikes for   Pacificano’   needs.
c)          Rate the top 3   candidate   e-bikes   using   a Weighted   Decision   Matrix
d)          Provide your   recommendations for a Gold, Silver   or   Bronze   solution.
e)       Justify your team’s   recommended   e-bike(s)   selection   and   identify   nextsteps   in the   procurement   process.
